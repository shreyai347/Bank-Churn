# Bank Churn Prediction Model 📊💳

## Overview 🌟
This project aims to predict customer churn in a banking context using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, we can identify patterns and factors leading to customer attrition, enabling banks to take proactive measures to retain their clients.

## Key Features 🚀
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess customer data to ensure quality inputs for the model.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implement various algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting churn.
- **Data Visualization**: Use visualizations to gain insights into customer behavior and churn factors.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
